1. User Account Management
Sign Up and Login: Users can sign up and log in using their email and password.
JWT Authentication: The system uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication and authorization. After login, a JWT is generated and sent to the client for subsequent authenticated requests.
Password Encryption: User passwords are securely stored using bcrypt. Passwords are hashed before being saved in the database, and during login, the entered password is compared against the hashed password.
User CRUD Operations: Users can update their profiles, and admins can manage user accounts, including adding, editing, or deleting user details.
2. Admin Functionality
Admin Seeder: Initial seeder for creating the admin user. The admin account is set up with special permissions to perform CRUD operations on jobs, job categories, and user management.
Admin CRUD Operations: The admin can create, update, and delete jobs, job categories, and manage user roles and permissions.
3. Job and Job Category Management
Job CRUD Operations: The admin can add new jobs, update job details, delete jobs, and view all available jobs in the system.
Job Category CRUD Operations: Administrators can create and manage different job categories, making it easier to categorize job postings for users.
4. Error Handling and Logging
Custom error handling middleware is used to capture and log errors.
All database operations are wrapped in try-catch blocks to ensure that any unexpected behavior is handled gracefully.
The logging mechanism (log) is integrated throughout the application to record all critical events, errors, and operations for debugging and monitoring purposes.
5. Job Recommendation System
Recommendation Algorithm: The system provides personalized job recommendations based on a user's profile, skills, experience level, and preferences.
The algorithm compares the user's profile against available jobs and assigns a score to each job based on how well it matches the user's skills, experience, and preferences.
The job recommendations are ranked and sorted based on the score, ensuring that users receive the most relevant job opportunities first.
Detailed Explanation of the Recommendation Algorithm
The recommendation system leverages a scoring algorithm that assigns points based on several criteria. Below is a breakdown of the approach:

Fetch User Profile:

When a user requests job recommendations, the system first retrieves the user’s profile using their userId.
The user profile includes the user's skills, experience level, and preferences such as job types, roles, locations, and expected salary range.
Fetch All Jobs:

The algorithm retrieves all available jobs from the database. Each job is then evaluated against the user's profile.
Scoring Mechanism:

Each job is scored based on how well it matches the user's profile. The scoring factors include:
Skill Match: The algorithm checks if the user's skills match the required skills for the job. Each matching skill contributes a higher weight (e.g., 3 points) since skill matching is crucial.
Experience Level Match: If the job's required experience level matches the user's experience level, additional points are added to the score.
Location Preference Match: The system checks if the job’s location matches the user's preferred locations and adds points accordingly.
Job Type Match: If the job type (e.g., full-time, part-time) matches the user's preferred job types, points are added.
Role Match: If the job role is within the user's preferred roles, it receives additional points.
Expected Salary Range Match: If the job's salary range is within the user's expected salary range, additional points are added.
Sorting and Filtering:

After scoring all jobs, the jobs are filtered to exclude those with a score of zero, indicating no match with the user's profile.
The jobs are then sorted in descending order based on the score, so that the highest-ranking jobs appear first in the recommendations list.
Returning Recommendations:

Finally, the algorithm returns the top-ranked jobs as recommendations to the user. The response includes the job details and their respective scores.
Example Scoring Calculation
For a job posting with the following requirements:

Required Skills: ['JavaScript', 'React', 'Node.js']
Experience Level: Mid-Level
Location: New York
Job Type: Full-Time
Role: Frontend Developer
Salary Range: $70,000 - $90,000
Assume the user has the following profile:

Skills: ['JavaScript', 'Node.js', 'CSS']
Experience Level: Mid-Level
Preferred Locations: ['New York', 'San Francisco']
Preferred Job Types: ['Full-Time']
Preferred Roles: ['Frontend Developer']
Expected Salary Range: $60,000 - $100,000
The job would receive a score as follows:

Skill Match: 2 matching skills (JavaScript, Node.js) = 2 * 3 points = 6 points
Experience Level Match: Mid-Level matches = 2 points
Location Match: New York matches preferred locations = 2 points
Job Type Match: Full-Time matches = 1 point
Role Match: Frontend Developer matches = 2 points
Salary Range Match: Job's salary range is within expected salary range = 2 points
Total Score: 15 points

This scoring system allows for a detailed and flexible matching of user profiles to job postings, ensuring that users receive highly relevant job recommendations.
